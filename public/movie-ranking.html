    <h1>Best Movies According to J&ouml;rn Leismann</h1>
    <h2>My 3 top Movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
    <p>Great Mixture of using Animation and Robotics.
    There are many Dinosaurs as well, I mean, come on, Dinosaurs...
    This Movie also includes some social critics i like much, too.</p>

    <h3>Star Wars (First Trilogy, old Movies)</h3>
    <p>As a kind of Science-Fiction fan i really like Star Wars.
    The Story is great and the Effects are really good too compared to from what years these movies are and what possibiliites they had then.
    They created many details in it by building something up together by using some random stuff.</p>

    <h3>Wolf of Wall-Street</h3>
    <p>Really funny movie which made me laugh a lot.
    It has some Drama as well.</p>
